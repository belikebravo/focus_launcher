# Focus Launcher 🚀

**Reclaim your attention. Focus on what matters.**

Focus Launcher is a minimal Android launcher designed to combat digital addiction and mindless scrolling. Instead of maximizing engagement, it maximizes **intention**.

## 🎯 Motive
Modern apps are engineered to keep you hooked. Focus Launcher introduces **positive friction**:
-   Want to open Instagram? You have to wait 10 seconds.
-   Bored? Read a "Knowledge Nugget" generated by AI instead of doom-scrolling.
-   Need to work? Turn on "Deep Focus" to lock away distractions completely.

## ✨ Features

-   **🧠 Knowledge Hub**: The home screen displays bite-sized facts ("Nuggets") on topics you care about. Powered by **Google Gemini AI**.
-   **🛡️ Deep Focus Mode**: A strict mode that blocks distracting apps (Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube) and only allows your "Favorites".
-   **⏳ Friction & Intention**: Attempting to open a blocked app triggers a "Learning Overlay", forcing you to pause and reflect before proceeding.
-   **⭐️ Favorites**: Pin your essential tools (Phone, Maps, Notes) for quick access.
-   **🎨 Minimalist UI**: No cluttered icons, no notification badges. Just text and focus.
